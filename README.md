# Heart-Disease-Analysis
A Comprehensive Analysis of Heart Disease Incidence 
Project Title: Heart Disease Prediction Analysis
Tools Used: Python, Power BI
Dataset Source: Kaggle

In this project, I analyzed heart disease data from Kaggle, focusing on factors like age, sex, chest pain, and blood pressure to uncover critical patterns. Key insights include:

Age Impact: Highest risk between 40-58 years.
Sex-Specific Findings: Females without exercise angina are at higher risk.
Critical Indicators: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment, angina, and chest pain.
Logistic Regression emerged as the top performer, achieving 87% accuracy on both training and test datasets, with an AUC score of 88.
